# Unity Multiplayer Card Game (Kabo)

"Multiplayer card game created using Unity Engine"

Author: Sayan Mandal

This is a project for the Summer Of Code (SOC) 2025 under the guidance of mentor Vedant Parkhe.

## Things I got to learn

- Creating the logic loop behind the card game.
- Learned the basics of making a multiplayer connection(client-server) through Unity NetCode and RPC system.
- Using NetworkOjects and NetworkBehaviours to spawn objects in the network.
- Creation of lobbies and relays for players to connect even from different network using the Unity Lobby and Relay Services.
- Managing reconnection of players who lost their connection.
- Upload the whole project to the GitHub Repository.

Note: This is the project file for the game and does not contain the final playable application that runs the game. To do so open the project in the Unity Editor and then 'Build' it.
